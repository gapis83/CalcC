# Calc_C: Calculator with Expression Evaluation and Graph Plotting
This project is an advanced calculator implemented in C language version 2011. It allows users to perform calculations with integers and real numbers, evaluate arbitrary arithmetic expressions, plot function graphs, and even calculate loan details using the loan calculator mode. The program separates the business logic from the user interface. The business logic is written in C, while the interface is created using C++. The implementation includes unit tests using the Check library. The graphical user interface is created using the Qt library, providing a modern and cross-platform GUI. The goal of the project is to provide a reliable and easy-to-use calculator with advanced features.

Here are some additional details about the project.

1. Language: C (version 2011) and C++.
